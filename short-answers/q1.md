# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

`Outside promise` will print first because it a is synchronous while `Promise.resolve` is asynchronous. Synchronous code always runs first.
